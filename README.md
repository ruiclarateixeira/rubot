# RUBOT

My personal bot - starting with a very naive approach and just keep on adding feature and improving the code. Long term project with no end goal or finish line.

## Ideas
	* Morning E-Mail Clean-up
	* Twitter scrapping (Based on likes/retweets/following -> suggest tweets)
	* Various communication channels: Text message, email, twitter..

## In Development
	* Executing scheduled commands

## Implemented
	* Responding to inputs

## Dependencies
	* sinatra
	* twilio-ruby
