# RUBOT

My personal bot - starting with a very naive approach and just keep on adding feature and improving the code. Long term project with no end goal or finish line.

## Ideas
   * Morning E-Mail Clean-up
   * Twitter scrapping (Based on likes/retweets/following -> suggest tweets)

## In Development
   * Executing scheduled commands

## Implemented
   * Responding to inputs
